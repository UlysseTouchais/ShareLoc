# DiHabitIs,  a data story made by ShareLoc
In a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029018/) analyzing a record of 420M food items purchased at
Tesco in greater London, researchers identified nutrients that were highly correlated with diabetes. They also concluded diversifying nutrients is key to avoid this disease. 

We, ShareLoc, would like to dig further in this dataset and look if other factors correlate with diabetes risk. We are mainly going to look if age and income have impact on diabetes (in an area scale). 

## Young, fats and sweets
Our first step is to differentiate areas by age. We have access to three groups of age : 
- young : 0 to 17 years
- adult : 18 to 64 years
- old   : 65+ years

We computed the age densities of each population (e.g young_density = #young/total_population) and hereby plot the
correlations between the age densities and diabetes prevalence :
(N.B: we only took into account correlations having a p-value < 0.05, for our entire study)

{% include_relative html/age_diab_corr.html%}

**Surprising !** The younger the population, the higher its diabetes prevalence score. Older population tend not to be
affected though. So what do younger areas like so much that adults don't like ? To check this, we plot the correlation between age density of youngs and adults vs the products distribution of the areas. 

{% include_relative html/age_prod_corr.html %}

Looking at the yellow bars, we identify a little clichÃ© of the teenager who eats cereals in the morning, says **no** to fruits and veggies but **yes** to sweets and soft drinks ! Of course,the teenager can not buy beer and wine for legal reasons. But weirdly enough, younger populations tend to buy more spirits... We let the reader imagine why. 

Having the food habits of the younger population under the eyes, we now look for the correlations between diabetes prevalence and product consumption:
{% include_relative html/prod_diab_corr.html %}

What a surprise ! Younger areas buy more products that are positively correlated with diabetes.

Furthermore, surprising observations emerge from these graphs. In particular, we
notice that water has high diabetes prevalence. We do not think that bottled water is direclty related to diabetes. However, perhaps areas buying more bottled water instead of water from the tap are areas with lower quality of life. We do not have yet access to data permitting us to dig further in this aspect, and therefore leave this for further study. 

## Modeling diabetes prevalence
From the above barcharts, we are interested in viewing a scatter plot of young density vs diabetes prevalence. We add two features to the scatter plot: the entropy of nutrients represented by the color and the number of gp patients represented by the radius. We decided to include the entropy because it is one of the main finding of the previous research and the number of gp patients to check if there is no bias at that scale. 

{% include_relative html/age_diab_scatter.html %}

It appears that younger areas food habits are correlated with low entropy. This is consistent with the previous research which shows that entropy is negatively correlated with diabetes and our above discoveries which show that younger areas are positively correlated with diabetes. 

Let's now switch the y-axis and the color-axis of the previous graph:
{% include_relative html/h_age_scatter_diab.html %} 
Based on this, we would like to perform a classification model that would estimate if an area has a high or low diabetes prevalence based on only two features : young density and entropy of nutrients. The fact to have two features is convenient for visualization. 

We have selected the threshold for high and low based on the diabetes prevalence median, that is, a score of 6,1. 

{% include_relative html/true_plot.html %}

We tried two models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

## What's On with Net Income ?

Finally, we would like to observe if there are any differences on products consumption between richer or poorer areas and if so, we would like to konw if it has an impact on diabetes. To do this, we start by plotting the average net annual income of local authorities. 
 
{% include_relative html/Income_classes.html %}

In this chart, local authorities are separated in 3 categories based on their average net annual income. We used the 1st and 3rd quartile of the income distribution to diferentiate low and medium income areas, higher income areas lie then above the 3rd quartile. We now plot nutrient consumptions grouped by income groups:

{% include_relative html/prod_income.html%}

We do not notice huge differences in terms of product consumptions, but a key observation is that higher income classes
 tend to buy more products that are negatively correlated with diabetes prevalence whereas lower income buy more 
 products that are positively correlated with diabetes prevalence.
